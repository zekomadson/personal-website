                <p>The purpose of this page is to showcase the idea that was mentioned by Dev on 3/30/23, a new feature
                    for
                    Spotify or general music listeners.</p>
                <p>The idea is that a user can opt-in to this application that will allow people near you to see and
                    potentially
                    hear or join the session of music that you are currently listening to.</p>
