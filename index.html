            <ul>Project 3: Recipe Converter
                <ul>Brief Project Description
                    <li>This project was a last minute addition inspired by the frustration of finding holiday related recipes for a gathering with my friends.
                        All online recipes seem to have a horrible habit of wrapping a simple list of ingredients and steps with a 1000 word life story of the writer. 
                        The sole purpose of this website is to eliminate the bullshit that encompasses these great recipes.
